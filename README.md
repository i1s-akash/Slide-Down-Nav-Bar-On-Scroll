# Slide-Down-Nav-Bar-On-Scroll
Finally completed another project which was just amazing experience with it. Everything is easy here but need to keep in mind one single thing that is if want to keep navigation bar responsive to every break-pints so give fixed height to its container or header, Mean to say It should be parent(Where i have coded navigation bar). 4th Day of jQuery Code
